Rules of the game:

1. The game is played on a decoding board where the challenge is a pattern of 4 code pegs.
2. The Code-Maker generate the challenge that is a random pattern of 4 code pegs
3. A code peg can be of one of the 6 different colors: white, yellow, green, blue, purple
4. The challenge can contain duplicated colors, it could be made of 4 code pegs of the same color
5. The Code-Breaker tries to guess the challenge, in both order and color, 
6. The Code-Maker communicate to the Code-Breaker the number of pegs in the guess that are correct 
   in both color and position and the pegs correct in color and wrong in position
7. After the feedback the Code-Breaker can make anothe guess, up to 7 turns
8. 1000 games are played with 1000 different challenges, the Code-Breaker that collect the higher 
   number of victories is the winner of the match
9. When 2 or more Code-Breakers collect the same higher number of victories, the one that made 
   the lower number of tries is the winner of the match 



Rules of the competition:

1. The spirit of the competition is to find the best MasterMind Code-Breaker algorithm.
2. Anything that is deemed against the spirit of the competition will be grounds for disqualification.
3. Interfering with an opponent (i.e. via reflection) is against the spirit of the competition.
5. A limit of 4 second of CPU time per game is allotted to each competitor on the primary thread.
6. Running out of time results in losing the current game.
7. Any unhandled exception will result in losing the current game.
8. Max total size (un-compressed) of an entry is 1 MB.
9. Original algorithms will compete against each other original algorithm so implementation of known
   algorithms will compete against each other known algorithm, there will be 1 winner for each category.
A. Your entry must implement the IMasterMindCodeBreaker interface
